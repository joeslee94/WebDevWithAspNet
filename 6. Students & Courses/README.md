Exploring Lists, Dictionaries, Object Initializers, and Collection Initializers
Overall concepts of the following were covered:
- Creting new Objects from Classes made within project
- Private fields with public properties
- List<>
- Dictionary<,>
- Initializing Objects and Collections
- foreach statements and specifying the portion to iterate through
- Changing button colors on properties tab

This was a simple (what was asked to be done) but complex (what needed to be implemented to accomplish the questions)
task that helped me realize the power of Lists and Dictionaries and how to properly iterate through them to get the desired output.
